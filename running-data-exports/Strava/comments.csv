"23 May 2014, 11:32:43","Hey dude, just the Welsh half in July at the moment. Had a problem with my knee over the last few weeks so been a frustrating time off. Hopefully can ease my way back into it now though."
"30 May 2014, 10:52:42",Epic.
"24 Aug 2014, 07:36:33","This winter Tom. I'm booked on the Gower one in November, and hoping to sign up for a few more after too. "
"31 Aug 2014, 18:00:20",Not too shabby Tom. 
"24 Oct 2014, 14:12:46",Entered the Gower one and going to hopefully sign up for a few more soon. You up for any? Also doing the Milton Keynes half marathon with Laura on 14th December if you fancy it?
"19 Feb 2015, 13:28:42","Nah, just a run with Laura! But I did do pretty much the same route as a race back in November. Really awesome place to run."
"29 Mar 2015, 12:09:09",Awesome time Tom! 
"16 Apr 2015, 16:22:12",Riding up hill Adam?! 
"21 Apr 2015, 09:33:07","Ha! Forgot you'd still be covered in snow! Good man, still on that hardtail? I'm really good cheers. Lots of trail running and biking when I can! Are you a permanent Canadian resident yet? "
"4 May 2015, 09:09:51","Haha, not too bad. I was pretty broken after 20k. It's hard to pace yourself when you can't remember how many hills are left! "
"26 Aug 2015, 09:44:33",Some serious elevation you achieved there Tom!
"3 Apr 2016, 22:03:28",Extra resistance.
"9 Apr 2016, 18:17:12",Think you need to improve your pace Jean.

"3 Oct 2016, 14:01:30",You still need your bar code if you want an official race participation and time with parkrun. 
"3 Oct 2016, 14:07:58",Just a short ride this weekend then Tom? ;) 
"16 Oct 2016, 15:37:04","Cheers Ems! Yes correct, never been before. Went up Fan Foel then along the ridge and back down. Those fells are hard work! "

"27 May 2020, 08:41:13",The rule on Strava is you have to post a sassy picture of yourself wearing your new kit. Also your run title should be 'Testing out the new shorts' and in the description you need to give a detailed account of why they made you faster / slower üòÇ

"18 Aug 2020, 07:53:21",Been there many times Eira. Running sucks sometimes. Forget about it for a few weeks and do something else. Then try it again. First few runs will feel heavy and slow but after those you'll start to feel good again. 
"10 Sep 2020, 18:47:25",Congrats guys. Lovely place for it! 
"18 Sep 2020, 19:33:12",Behave Tom

"5 Nov 2020, 21:17:05",It's long üòÇ just settle in and don't wear yourself out too early. I think it unlocks at level 10 or something.
