"23 May 2014, 11:32:43","Hey dude, just the Welsh half in July at the moment. Had a problem with my knee over the last few weeks so been a frustrating time off. Hopefully can ease my way back into it now though."
"30 May 2014, 10:52:42",Epic.
"24 Aug 2014, 07:36:33","This winter Tom. I'm booked on the Gower one in November, and hoping to sign up for a few more after too. "
"31 Aug 2014, 18:00:20",Not too shabby Tom. 
"24 Oct 2014, 14:12:46",Entered the Gower one and going to hopefully sign up for a few more soon. You up for any? Also doing the Milton Keynes half marathon with Laura on 14th December if you fancy it?
"19 Feb 2015, 13:28:42","Nah, just a run with Laura! But I did do pretty much the same route as a race back in November. Really awesome place to run."
"29 Mar 2015, 12:09:09",Awesome time Tom! 
"16 Apr 2015, 16:22:12",Riding up hill Adam?! 
"21 Apr 2015, 09:33:07","Ha! Forgot you'd still be covered in snow! Good man, still on that hardtail? I'm really good cheers. Lots of trail running and biking when I can! Are you a permanent Canadian resident yet? "
"4 May 2015, 09:09:51","Haha, not too bad. I was pretty broken after 20k. It's hard to pace yourself when you can't remember how many hills are left! "
"26 Aug 2015, 09:44:33",Some serious elevation you achieved there Tom!
"3 Apr 2016, 22:03:28",Extra resistance.
"9 Apr 2016, 18:17:12",Think you need to improve your pace Jean. 
"9 Apr 2016, 18:18:54",Nice pins Sammy. 
"6 May 2016, 14:41:52",Nice one Sammy boy.

"8 Sep 2016, 09:34:43",Finally got one! Wish I'd bought the fenix.
"3 Oct 2016, 14:01:30",You still need your bar code if you want an official race participation and time with parkrun. 
"3 Oct 2016, 14:07:58",Just a short ride this weekend then Tom? ;) 
"16 Oct 2016, 15:37:04","Cheers Ems! Yes correct, never been before. Went up Fan Foel then along the ridge and back down. Those fells are hard work! "
"23 Oct 2016, 22:08:49",Getting into the hills are we?! Great run dude. 
"1 Nov 2016, 22:26:35",Racking up a few miles with this commuting Matt!

"25 Mar 2017, 19:09:05","Nice one Sammy, how was it? "
"25 Mar 2017, 19:20:28","Unfortunately not, hurt my hip a few weeks ago so not done much recently. Hopefully back on it Monday :) "

"27 Apr 2017, 07:14:56","Not bad I think considering I've hardly run over the last month. Really high standard, haven't seen the results yet. Loved it :) "
"29 Apr 2017, 20:08:42",Fair play Ben! 
"30 Apr 2017, 15:22:24",Epic Tom. You've raised the bar. 
"13 May 2017, 10:39:02","Cheers fellas. Faster than expected, I'm getting back in to it, coming for you Tom! "
"13 May 2017, 10:39:24","Middle of June Sammy, need to get some miles in before then! "
"18 May 2017, 09:24:28",My eyes are always closed in photos.
"21 May 2017, 20:21:12","Good cheers Tom, didn't really plan it, just kept going! Marathon distance is in reach. "
"21 May 2017, 20:25:59",A little ramble round the block Sam! 
"25 May 2017, 18:07:04",Smashed it Kel. 
"28 May 2017, 10:55:55","Haha cheers guys! Finished 13th out of 59. 12mins off the winner. Paced myself much better, so pretty pleased! "
"11 Jun 2017, 19:31:52",Very good Kel! 
"11 Jun 2017, 19:33:43",Awesome Tom. I love it when Laura cycles next to me running.

"1 Sep 2017, 15:38:13","Haha, I can say for sure right now they are not as fast as your bike Roland!"
"1 Sep 2017, 15:40:54",We'll be back home for a ride soon :)
"4 Sep 2017, 12:11:41",An extended commute yes! Add some hills and distance in. 
"15 Sep 2017, 19:51:26","I know Roland! Don't worry though, Tom just sorted me out and I'll be back soon 👍"
"24 Sep 2017, 19:57:25","We've just been to Skye, stunning place. "
"13 Feb 2018, 09:52:54","Not at the moment Tom, just trying to build some fitness back up. Would like to do a few fell races soon. "

"20 Sep 2018, 13:55:14",It's the name of the mountain chez. It's a short walk from the top of the gondola at kicking horse resort. It was a bit of a scramble near the top you would have loved it!

"13 Sep 2019, 11:15:47",Hilarious route dude ;)
"13 Sep 2019, 13:04:31",Hahaha I left the car at work yesterday so had no choice. I figured a short slow downhill run wouldn't be so bad on a rest day.

"3 Oct 2019, 17:37:58",I love then too. Can't wait to get mine on 😂
"3 Oct 2019, 19:17:22",It's hard to argue with that Barnett! And spot on chez. 
"5 Oct 2019, 19:53:05","😂 To be fair, Bono runs faster than anyone, but he stops to sniff stuff a lot. "

"15 Nov 2019, 12:18:36",Skipping work to get it done 💪
"15 Nov 2019, 12:22:52",You went up one of the biggest climbs in the game 😂 Zwift has some interesting climbing mechanics depending on your set up - try a flat ride and see what your average is? 
"23 Nov 2019, 13:52:40",Epic Ash 👊😎
"26 Nov 2019, 19:16:15",Getting keen for some speed chez?! 
"26 Nov 2019, 20:27:02",Yeah good man. You've been running consistently for a while so not surprised you found it comfortable. 5 min miles round garstang 10...
"7 Dec 2019, 15:39:21",😂
"7 Dec 2019, 22:36:35","Cheers boys! Great race, paced myself quite well and not too muddy. Think I snuck a sub 20 5k in there somewhere too 😉"
"14 Dec 2019, 18:17:26",Haha fortunately not face to the floor - more of a wash out and slide down on my side! Got a decent graze and limp to show for it now 😂
"14 Dec 2019, 18:17:34",Harry? 
"14 Dec 2019, 19:23:09",Gotcha. Yeah he didn't stay in sight for long!

"16 Jan 2020, 14:01:33",17km in 30mins - world record pace
"16 Jan 2020, 15:51:52",You're right. Those 90m really hurt. 
"8 Feb 2020, 15:50:49",Wow! 
"18 Feb 2020, 11:02:48",The big lad has been putting in some miles to be fair! He'd probably run 9.5k then get distracted. 
"25 Feb 2020, 10:24:48",Literally had one yesterday 😂
"2 Mar 2020, 19:42:19",Yeah Manchester at beginning of April Ben 
"8 Mar 2020, 13:28:29",Great work Damo 👏

"24 May 2020, 19:32:02",Very nice Steph! 
"27 May 2020, 08:41:13",The rule on Strava is you have to post a sassy picture of yourself wearing your new kit. Also your run title should be 'Testing out the new shorts' and in the description you need to give a detailed account of why they made you faster / slower 😂
"27 May 2020, 08:41:31",Great run btw 
"28 May 2020, 12:48:03",Bravo 🙌
"30 May 2020, 18:39:41",Lovely photo 📸

"28 Jul 2020, 06:55:34",Fast Ash. Stop pausing your watch 😂
"28 Jul 2020, 06:57:49",That looks like a Slow Worm Chez. Ironic name. Still really cool. 
"28 Jul 2020, 06:58:42","Adders have a distinct pattern down their backs, and they're pretty hench. "
"28 Jul 2020, 10:37:36",Blimey Jo!

"9 Aug 2020, 08:33:03","Superb, Jonesy 👏😎"
"18 Aug 2020, 07:53:21",Been there many times Eira. Running sucks sometimes. Forget about it for a few weeks and do something else. Then try it again. First few runs will feel heavy and slow but after those you'll start to feel good again. 
"10 Sep 2020, 18:47:25",Congrats guys. Lovely place for it! 
"18 Sep 2020, 19:33:12",Behave Tom

"12 Oct 2020, 07:22:58",😂 You literally live on the hill! Get up there! 
"13 Oct 2020, 18:32:49",Yeah it was a tad uphill! 
"16 Oct 2020, 13:52:08","Haha, that's what I'm calling it Tom! "
"28 Oct 2020, 19:02:04",Tell me more? 
"28 Oct 2020, 19:19:25",Very nice. Looks like your pretty much there! 
"31 Oct 2020, 13:31:34",Now put your feet up Gab 😂
"5 Nov 2020, 21:17:05",It's long 😂 just settle in and don't wear yourself out too early. I think it unlocks at level 10 or something. 
"5 Nov 2020, 21:17:52",It's an hour or so of climbing and 10 mins of descending 
"6 Nov 2020, 18:53:20",Behave Sam! Awesome running 🔥
"13 Nov 2020, 19:34:27",😂 Cheers Ben. You had a decent amount of climbing for the distance to be fair. You got your tyres blown up properly? 😉

"10 Jan 2021, 16:11:21",👏
"17 Jan 2021, 12:15:06",Big run that Adam 👏

"24 Feb 2021, 18:57:18",Big Dog on the weights! 
"24 Feb 2021, 20:28:36",Try using a mountain bike on the jungle loop Bec! Zwift made them more efficient on the gravel
"10 Mar 2021, 17:41:48",Thanks Tom - thought it was you. Nice running. I'm a big fan of the route you did.
"10 Mar 2021, 17:41:56",Thanks Helen!
